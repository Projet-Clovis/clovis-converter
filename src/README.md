# Source code folder
## Presentation
Each folder consists of an input format: every format supported in input has an associated folder.

In each of these folder, there is also one folder for every output format.

For example, the code for converting Clovis to LaTeX (`.tex` file) is located at `ðŸ“‚ src/from_clovis/to_tex/`.

## Folder organization
